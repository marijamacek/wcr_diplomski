## ⚙️ Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure the following components are installed on your system:

### 1. Python 3.12.x

Download and install Python 3.12.x from the official Python website:

🔗 [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

During installation:

- Make sure to check **"Add Python to PATH"**.
- Verify installation by running:

```bash
python --version
2. ROS 2 Humble
Follow the official ROS 2 Humble installation guide:

🔗 https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation.html

Quick install for Ubuntu 22.04:
bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt update && sudo apt install curl gnupg lsb-release
sudo curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.key -o /usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg] http://packages.ros.org/ros2/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros2.list > /dev/null
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ros-humble-desktop
After installation, set up the ROS 2 environment:
bash
Copy
Edit
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
3. NVIDIA Isaac Sim & Isaac Lab
Download and install Isaac Sim and Isaac Lab from the NVIDIA Omniverse website:

🔗 https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-sim

Installation Steps:
Sign in to the NVIDIA Developer portal and download the installer for Isaac Sim.

Follow the official installation instructions provided on the download page.

To install Isaac Lab, follow the instructions in the Isaac Sim documentation or download it from the same page.

Note: Ensure your system meets the necessary hardware and software requirements listed on the NVIDIA website.

Copy wcr.py and paste it into the following directory:

bash
Copy

🏋️‍♂️ Train & Play (Linux commands)
Training
To see training with a small number of environments:

bash
Copy
Edit
python3 scripts/reinforcement_learning/skrl/train.py --task Isaac-Wcr-Direct-v0 --num_envs 32
To accelerate training with more environments and headless mode (no graphical interface):

bash
Copy
Edit
python3 scripts/reinforcement_learning/skrl/train.py --task Isaac-Wcr-Direct-v0 --num_envs 4096 --headless
Playing
To run the best policy learned to this point (requires at least some training to generate a .pth file):

bash
Copy
Edit
python3 scripts/reinforcement_learning/skrl/play.py --task Isaac-Leatherback-Direct-v0 --num_envs 32
